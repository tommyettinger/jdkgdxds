/**
 * An Iterator specialized for {@code int} values.
 * This iterates over primitive ints using {@link #nextInt()}.
 * <br>
 * This is roughly equivalent to {@code IntIterator} in Java 8, and is present here so environments
 * don't fully support Java 8 APIs (such as RoboVM) can use it.
 * <br>
 * This interface is closely based on {@code IntIterator} in OpenJDK 8.
 * This iterator interface is extremely simple and there's no way to implement it in a way
 * that respects compatibility other than the way OpenJDK 8 does.

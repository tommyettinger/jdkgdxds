/**
 * A customizable variant on ObjectMap that uses Iterable keys made of K sub-keys, and only considers a sub-key (for
 * equality and hashing purposes) if that sub-key satisfies a predicate. This can also edit the sub-keys that pass
 * the filter, such as to normalize their data during comparisons (and hashing). You will usually want to call
 * {@link #setFilter(ObjPredicate)} and/or {@link #setEditor(ObjToSameFunction)} to change the behavior of hashing and
 * equality before you enter any keys, unless you have specified the filter and/or editor you want in the constructor.
 * Calling {@link #setModifiers(ObjPredicate, ObjToSameFunction)} is recommended if you need to set both the filter and
 * the editor; you could also set them in the constructor.
 * <br>
 * This class is related to {@link FilteredStringMap}, which can be seen as using a String as a key and the characters
 * of that String as its sub-keys. That means this is also similar to {@link CaseInsensitiveMap}, which is essentially
 * a specialized version of FilteredIterableMap (which can be useful for serialization).
